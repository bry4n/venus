Installation
-------------
Ensure you have a backup of your .vimrc, .gvimrc, and .vim directory before you try this out.

  git clone git://github.com/bry4n/venus.git
  cd venus
  rake install

Assuming that you already have git, ruby (system), and rake. If you are using RVM, please run 'rvm use system' before installing vim plugins [1].

[1]: Command-T build requires ruby (system) in order to build ruby C extension successfully. You can disable Command-T by commenting out some lines in .vimrc and Rakefile.
