Assuming that you already have git, ruby (system), and rake. If you are using RVM, please run 'rvm use system' before installing vim plugins [1].

  [1]: Command-T build requires ruby (system) in order to build ruby C extension successfully. You can disable Command-T by commenting out .vimrc and Rakefile.
