Installation
-------------

  git clone git://github.com/bry4n/venus.git
  cd venus
  rake backup   # this will make a backup of your .vimrc, .gvimrc, and .vim directory 
  rake install

Assuming that you already have git, ruby (system), and rake. If you are using RVM, please run 'rvm use system' before installing vim plugins [1].

[1]: Command-T build requires ruby (system) in order to build ruby C extension successfully. You can disable Command-T by commenting out some lines in .vimrc and Rakefile.
